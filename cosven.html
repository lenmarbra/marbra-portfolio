        <h1>Cosimo Veneziano</h1>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Appunti</h3>
        <p class="intro-text">In this project I designed the book layout
          of "Cosimo Veneziano, Appunti" containing three
          articles. The focus of the articles' content varied which
          I encountered in my design including layout, colours, illustrations, 
          and typography. Text and article images were provided.

      <h4>Concept</h4>
      <p>Inclusion - including aspects from different views and angles in the devopment of art. It’s important to following the hole
        journey of the creation of art - the origin as well as the process of development and it’s influences along the way.</p>

      <!-- illustrations design -->
      <article id="Illustrations">
        <p class="ill-text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Illustrations</span> - extra focus on the eagle which is an old animal with sharp eyes. They can see details 
            even from a very far distance. Playing with the angles to visualize the concept of viewing and intepreting art from different views, including it all.</p>

      <!-- typography design -->
      <article id="typography">
        <p class="typo-text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Typefaces</span> - Bodoni is one of my favorite and I think its traditional elegance goes well with the concept and the content of the articles, as well as the concept. Montserrat, a sans serif with its simple and clean style is used for smaller and informative texts like footnotes. The style of the Montserrat’s typephase makes it easy for the readers to read the text and it goes well with Bodoni as a contrast. </p>

      <!-- color-palette -->
      <article id="color-palette">
        <p class="color-text"><span style="font-weight:bold">Colour palette</span>- the colours are picked from the images and arts from the content of the book. They are suttle but still stands out which fetches the overall feel of the book. </p>

<!-- grid -->
    <section class="grid">
      <h4>Grid</h4> 
      <p>I found a 6 column grid with a gutter of 0,75 cm fitting my composition of the three works the best. For the Essay and the Interview I have used the two inner columns mainly for footnotes and the other four columns for the main text. For the Works section I’ve used the inner two columns for the image which aslo covers the previous page. And the main text is here also using the four outer columns. It also works well with the Table of Conent were the text is divided into two columns.</p>
